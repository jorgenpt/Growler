Growler
=======

Setup
-----

To set Growler up for use in your project, you need to configure it to build
with the Growl framework, then just drop the four files in this directory into
your project.

Growler has only been tested with Growl 1.2.x and above.

For instructions on setting up Growl in your project, see the official page on
[Implementing Growl][1], under the "Including and linking against the Growl
framework" header.
